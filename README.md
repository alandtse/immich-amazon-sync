# immich-amazon-sync

One-way sync from one or more [Immich](https://immich.app) albums into an **album** in [Amazon Photos](https://www.amazon.de/photos), with amazon.de as the default region.

This is a fork of [vanessa/immich-amazon-sync](https://github.com/vanessa/immich-amazon-sync) (MIT, based on commit `6d95d8c`). It was built for the same purpose: show self-hosted Immich photos on an **Amazon Echo Show**, which only accepts Amazon Photos as a photo source. Changes compared to upstream:

- Works with **Immich ≥ 3.2**: album contents come from `POST /api/search/metadata` with cursor pagination. Upstream relies on `GET /api/albums/{id}` → `assets`, which Immich 3.x no longer returns.
- Configurable region (default **Germany / amazon.de**), with the upload host and cookie names derived from it.
- Targets an Amazon Photos **album** (created if missing), not just the library root.
- Safety: a deletion brake, dry-run mode, file name sanitising, secrets from files, no secrets in logs, non-root container.
- Robustness: streaming downloads and uploads, atomic and versioned state, clear handling of expired cookies, 409 conflict resolution by MD5.

> [!WARNING]
> **Amazon Photos has no public API.** This tool uses the internal Amazon Drive v1 endpoints the web app uses, authenticated with your browser cookies. Amazon can change or block this at any time, and using it may conflict with Amazon's terms of use. Use at your own risk, and always start with a dry run.

## How it works

```
Immich albums ──(search/metadata, download original)──▶ Amazon Drive v1 upload (root folder)
                                                         └─▶ add node to Amazon Photos album
```

- Every run collects all assets of the configured Immich albums (non-trashed, visibility `timeline` or `archive`, i.e. exactly what the album shows).
- New assets are downloaded, streamed to the Amazon Photos root folder and then added to the album `AP_ALBUM_NAME` in batches.
- In `SYNC_MODE=mirror`, assets no longer in **any** configured album are removed from the Amazon album and, with `AP_DELETE_MODE=trash` (the default), moved to Amazon trash.
- In `SYNC_MODE=accumulate`, assets that leave Immich stay in the Amazon album to increase the Echo Show's rotation pool. `PRUNE_MODE=none` keeps them indefinitely; optional pruning only considers retired assets, never assets still in a source album. The `.env.example` starts in accumulate mode. Deleting an asset in Immich does not delete its Amazon copy in accumulate mode.
- Only nodes this tool uploaded or adopted (those listed in the state file) are ever touched. The state file maps Immich asset IDs to Amazon node IDs and is saved after every upload.

## Sync modes and retention

`SYNC_MODE=mirror` preserves the original behavior and is the code fallback when the variable is omitted. It removes assets from the Amazon album when they leave all configured Immich albums. `SYNC_MODE=accumulate` is the example configuration: it keeps those Amazon copies so a rotating or periodically refilled Immich album builds a larger slideshow pool. In accumulate mode, an Immich deletion is not propagated to Amazon unless an explicit prune policy selects that retired asset; consider the privacy implications before enabling it.

Accumulation pruning is disabled by default (`PRUNE_MODE=none`). Optional policies:

- `max_count`: prune the oldest retired assets when the total tracked set exceeds `PRUNE_MAX_COUNT`.
- `keep_recent`: prune retired assets whose last-seen time in Immich is older than `PRUNE_KEEP_RECENT_DAYS`.
- `both`: apply both rules (a retired asset is eligible if either rule selects it).

Active source-album assets are never pruned. If they alone exceed `PRUNE_MAX_COUNT`, the cap cannot be met; the tool warns and preserves them. Pruning uses the same incomplete-data guard, dry-run behavior and deletion brake as mirror mode; any sync error also blocks pruning for that run. When the brake blocks a prune run, the tool exits with code 2 and retains all candidates for a later run. `PRUNE_MODE` requires `SYNC_MODE=accumulate`; count and age values must be supplied when their policy is selected. `AP_DELETE_MODE=trash` moves pruned nodes to Amazon trash; `album_only` only removes them from the target album.

## Requirements

- Immich **3.2 or newer** (cursor-based search). Older versions are detected, and the run aborts with an error.
- An Amazon account with Amazon Photos (Prime), tested for amazon.de.
- Docker.

## Setup

> 🇩🇪 Step-by-step guide in German (Immich + Echo Show, Docker Compose): [docs/anleitung-de.md](docs/anleitung-de.md)

### 1. Build the image locally

The image is built from this repository. Do not pull it from a third-party registry.

```bash
git clone <your fork of this repo> immich-amazon-sync
cd immich-amazon-sync
docker build --pull -t immich-amazon-sync:local .
```

The base image is pinned by digest in the `Dockerfile`. To update it, change both the tag and the digest.

### 2. Create a restricted Immich API key

In Immich, go to **Account Settings → API Keys → New API Key**. Do not grant all permissions; select only:

| Permission       | Used for                                                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `album.read`     | `GET /api/albums`, `GET /api/albums/{id}` (`assetCount`)  |
| `asset.read`     | `POST /api/search/metadata`                               |
| `asset.download` | `GET /api/assets/{id}/original`                           |

`GET /api/server/version` (the version check) is public.

### 3. Get the Amazon Photos cookies (amazon.de)

1. Log in to <https://www.amazon.de/photos> in your browser.
2. Open DevTools (F12) → **Application** (Chrome/Edge) / **Storage** (Firefox) → **Cookies** → `https://www.amazon.de`. This list includes `HttpOnly` cookies.
3. Copy these three values:

   | Cookie       | Variable        |
   |--------------|-----------------|
   | `session-id` | `AP_SESSION_ID` |
   | `ubid-acbde` | `AP_UBID_VALUE` |
   | `at-acbde`   | `AP_AT_VALUE`   |

4. Optionally copy your browser's User-Agent (DevTools → Network → any request → `User-Agent`) into `AP_USER_AGENT`.

> **Note:** If `at-acbde` is missing from the cookie list, open **Network** → reload → any request to `www.amazon.de` → **Request Headers** → `cookie`, and copy the value after `at-acbde=` up to the next `;`.
>
> Do not log out of Amazon in that browser afterwards: logging out invalidates the cookies. Closing the browser is fine.

The cookies expire after a few weeks or months. When they do, every run stops at the first Amazon request with `cookies expired or invalid` (exit code 3). Copy fresh values and restart.

Other regions: set `AP_TLD` (for example `com`, `co.uk`, `fr`). Cookie names follow the pattern `ubid-acb<country>` / `at-acb<country>`, and `ubid-main` / `at-main` for amazon.com. The upload host is known for North America (`com`, `ca`) and EU marketplaces. For anything else, set `AP_CONTENT_URL`.

`IMMICH_URL` can point at the Immich container through a shared Docker network (`http://immich-server:2283`, see the German guide), or at a hostname or IP (`http://immich.local:2283`). A hostname that exists only in the host's `/etc/hosts` cannot be resolved by Docker. Use the IP in that case.

#### Using an existing Amazon Photos album

`AP_ALBUM_NAME` can name an album that already exists. It is matched by exact name, case-sensitive. The dry run logs `Amazon Photos album '<name>': <id>`. The ID must match the end of the album URL `https://www.amazon.<tld>/photos/album/<id>`. If the log shows `Would create` instead, the album was not found.

Photos that are already in the album are never touched. Only photos this tool added are removed again.

### 4. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
# edit .env
```

Prefer Docker secrets (`*_FILE` variables) for the cookies and API key, so they don't show up in `docker inspect`. See the Compose example below.

### 5. Prepare the data directory

The container runs as UID/GID `10001`. The data directory must be writable by that user:

```bash
mkdir -p data
sudo chown 10001:10001 data
chmod 700 data
```

### 6. Dry run first

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env -e DRY_RUN=true -e RUN_ONCE=true \
  -v ./data:/data immich-amazon-sync:local
```

The dry run checks the Immich version, the album lookup, the cookies (read-only Amazon requests) and the album lookup on Amazon. It then logs every planned upload and deletion. It writes nothing to Amazon and nothing to the state file, and it does not download any photos.

### 7. Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name immich-sync \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --env-file .env \
  -e DRY_RUN=false \
  -v ./data:/data \
  immich-amazon-sync:local
```

View logs:

```bash
docker logs -f immich-sync
```

With `--restart unless-stopped` (or `restart: unless-stopped` in Compose), the container comes back after a host reboot, as long as the Docker service starts at boot and the container wasn't stopped by hand. The first sync runs right after start. If Immich comes up later, that run fails without deleting anything, and the next attempt follows after `SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS`.

Force a sync now:

```bash
docker restart immich-sync
```

<details>
<summary>Docker Compose with secrets</summary>

```yaml
services:
  immich-sync:
    build: .
    image: immich-amazon-sync:local
    container_name: immich-sync
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env          # without the secret values
    environment:
      DRY_RUN: "false"

      AP_SESSION_ID_FILE: /run/secrets/ap_session_id
      AP_UBID_VALUE_FILE: /run/secrets/ap_ubid_value
      AP_AT_VALUE_FILE: /run/secrets/ap_at_value
    secrets: [immich_api_key, ap_session_id, ap_ubid_value, ap_at_value]
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    read_only: true
    tmpfs: [/tmp]
    cap_drop: [ALL]
    security_opt: ["no-new-privileges:true"]

secrets:
  immich_api_key: { file: ./secrets/immich_api_key }
  ap_session_id: { file: ./secrets/ap_session_id }
  ap_ubid_value: { file: ./secrets/ap_ubid_value }
  ap_at_value: { file: ./secrets/ap_at_value }
```

Without Swarm, Compose bind-mounts the secret files, so they must be readable by UID 10001 (`sudo chown 10001 secrets/*; sudo chmod 400 secrets/*`). If both are set, a `*_FILE` variable takes precedence over the plain variable.

`/tmp` is used for the downloaded original while it is being uploaded. For videos, make sure the tmpfs is larger than `MAX_FILE_MB`.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success (the healthcheck is pinged) |
| 1 | Errors: config problem, Immich unreachable or too old, album not found, individual uploads failed, `assetCount` mismatch |
| 2 | Planned deletions were **not** executed (deletion brake or incomplete Immich data) |
| 3 | Amazon answered 401/403 or redirected to the sign-in page, so the cookies have expired. The run was aborted. |

## Deletion safety

In mirror mode, removals happen when **all** of the following are true. Accumulate-mode pruning uses the same guards:

- Every album in `IMMICH_ALBUMS` was found, exactly once.
- Every Immich query succeeded.
- For every album, the number of assets found by the search equals `assetCount` from `GET /api/albums/{id}`.
- The run deletes at most `MAX_DELETE_COUNT` assets and at most `MAX_DELETE_FRACTION` of the assets tracked before the run (photos uploaded in the same run don't count).

Otherwise nothing is deleted, an error is logged and the exit code is 2. An empty or broken Immich response therefore never causes a mass deletion.

With small albums the fraction limit trips quickly (for example, removing 1 of 4 photos is 25%). To deliberately delete more, raise `MAX_DELETE_FRACTION` / `MAX_DELETE_COUNT` for one run. Ideally do a dry run first.

Changing `SYNC_TYPES` does not delete anything: only assets that left all Immich albums are removed.

**Albums that change completely and often** (for example refilled daily by a script) trip the brake on every run, and old photos stay in the Amazon album. Raise the limits permanently, e.g. `MAX_DELETE_FRACTION=1` and `MAX_DELETE_COUNT=500`. Incomplete Immich data still blocks deletions. However, if the automation briefly empties the album and a sync runs at exactly that moment, the Amazon album is emptied as well. Everything is uploaded again on the next run.

## State

`data/state.json` (mode `0600`, written atomically):

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "album_node_id": "amazon-album-node-id",
  "synced": { "immich-asset-uuid": "amazon-node-id" },
  "pending_album_add": [],
  "adopted_nodes": [],
  "first_added": { "immich-asset-uuid": "2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" },
  "last_seen": { "immich-asset-uuid": "2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" }
}
```

- `first_added` and `last_seen` store UTC timestamps used by age-based pruning. `last_seen` is refreshed while an asset remains in a configured Immich album; age retention is measured from when the asset left the source album.
- `pending_album_add` holds uploaded nodes that are not yet linked to the album. They are linked on the next run, so an interrupted run loses nothing.
- `adopted_nodes` holds nodes that already existed on Amazon (same MD5, found via a 409 conflict), for example a copy from the phone's own Amazon Photos backup. They are linked to the album and are **never trashed**. In mirror mode or when an explicit prune policy removes one, it is only removed from the album.
- The upstream format (`{"synced": {...}}`) is migrated automatically without re-uploading. On the first run, all previously synced photos are added to the album.
- If the album is deleted or renamed in Amazon Photos, it is looked up by name or recreated, and all tracked photos are linked again.
- If the state file is corrupt, the run aborts instead of silently starting from scratch.
- To start over, delete `data/state.json`. Existing uploads are matched again via the 409 conflict and MD5 comparison, not duplicated.
- Logs go to stdout and `data/immich-sync.log` (rotated at 5 MB, 3 backups, mode `0600`).

## Limitations

- **Cookie auth is fragile.** Cookies expire and must be refreshed by hand. There is no OAuth or API key flow.
- **Undocumented API.** Endpoints and request shapes come from the browser app and the [`amazon-photos`](https://github.com/trevorhobenshield/amazon_photos) library, not from official documentation.
- **Files land in the root folder.** They are then added to the album. An album is not a folder, so there is no way to upload into it directly.
- **Deduplication is by Immich asset ID.** On a 409 conflict, the existing Amazon node is adopted only if its MD5 matches. Otherwise the file is uploaded again under `<name>_<assetid8>.<ext>`.
- **Deleted photos go to the trash**, not permanent deletion. Empty the Amazon trash yourself if needed.

## Implementation notes and verification

- **Immich search shape.** Immich 3.2 deprecated the flat fields of `MetadataSearchDto` (`albumIds`, `visibility`, `page`, …) in favour of `filter` / `orderBy` / `cursor`. A request that uses only flat fields takes the legacy path, which returns `nextPage` but **never `nextCursor`**. Combining flat fields with `cursor` is rejected with HTTP 400. This tool therefore sends:

  ```json
  {"filter": {"albumIds": {"any": ["<id>"]},
              "visibility": {"in": ["archive", "timeline"]},
              "trashedAt": {"eq": null}},
   "size": 1000, "cursor": "<nextCursor>"}
  ```

  Verified against `open-api/immich-openapi-specs.json` and the server source at tag `v3.3.1` (`search.service.ts`, `utils/database.ts`, `album.repository.ts`).
- **Visibility.** In the structured path, only `locked` is excluded by default. `hidden` (for example the video part of live photos) and trashed assets would be included. `assetCount` counts `archive` + `timeline`, without trashed assets. The filter above mirrors exactly that, so archived photos in the album are synced.
- **Amazon (from `amazon-photos`, `_api.py`).**
  - EU upload host: `https://content-eu.drive.amazonaws.com/cdproxy/nodes`. North America: `content-na`.
  - Album: `POST /drive/v1/nodes` `{"kind": "VISUAL_COLLECTION", "name": …}`.
  - Add/remove: `PATCH /drive/v1/nodes/{albumId}/children` `{"op": "add" | "remove", "value": [nodeIds]}`.
  - Trash: `PATCH /drive/v1/trash` `{"op": "add", "value": [nodeIds], …}`, batched 50 at a time.
  - The library uploads to a folder via `parentNodeId`, with no way to upload into an album. Albums are collections, not parents.
